# SudoThing

Part of [SudoCare](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/SudoCare)

This is an iOS App that lets you upload a SudoThing to the server.
then we can have people get little points for fixing SudoThings or learning
about them or simply decorating them with art.

# Stuff

## Swift

Swift will be open sourced by the end of the year, so we should switched it from Obj-C to Swift by then.

## BackEnd

Temporarily put in parse. i do not want to keep this here long term, it is best on an open source private server, but I'm temporarily using Parse for now as proof of concept
